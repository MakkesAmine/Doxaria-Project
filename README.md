# Doxaria Project

## Overview

**Doxaria** is an AI-powered medical support tool designed to enhance the management of medical data by integrating cutting-edge technologies in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and recommendation systems. The platform extracts drug names and dosages from medical documents, generates contextual treatment recommendations, and suggests therapeutic alternatives. Delivered through a user-friendly web application, Doxaria empowers healthcare professionals and caregivers with intelligent, real-time insights.

---

## Purpose

The core mission of Doxaria is to **streamline the digitalization of medical processes** through:

- **Accurate drug information extraction** from medication packaging images.
- **Contextual treatment recommendations** generated via a fine-tuned GPT-2 model.
- **Alternative drug suggestions** based on semantic similarity using Sentence-BERT embeddings.
- A **scalable, web-based application** built with React and FastAPI, underpinned by MongoDB for data persistence.

---

## Key Features

- **üß† Object Detection**: Locates medication boxes and dosage indicators from uploaded images using a PyTorch-based model.
- **üîç OCR Pipeline**: Extracts and corrects text from identified image regions using transformer-based models.
- **ü§ñ Recommendation System**:
  - Contextual insights via GPT-2.
  - Semantic drug alternatives via Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **üåê Web Interface**: React frontend for uploading images, displaying results, receiving recommendations, and managing prescriptions.
- **üöÄ Backend Infrastructure**: FastAPI server with RESTful API endpoints for AI inference and data operations.
- **üóÉÔ∏è Database**: MongoDB for managing users, medications, and prescriptions.
